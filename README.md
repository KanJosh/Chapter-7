EXERCISES 7.1

1. Lithium hydride, LiH, decomposes (under appropriate conditions of temperature
and pressure) to solid Li and gaseous H2. Solid Li is a bcc crystal, while LiH has the NaCl structure. Construct an ab initio phase diagram for LiH and Li as a function of temperature and H2 pressure


Solution

Step 1
In this exercise, Li and LiH crystals were downloaded from materials project website while H2 molecule was drawn using Avogadro software. The geometry of the crystals and H2 molecules were optimized using Quantum Espresso
